Time col: __t__ | Label col: label | Features: n=322
Events (diagnosed): method=boolean, total_on_full=0
First 3 event times (s): []

Split policy (forced): HOLD starts PREPAD_SEC=300.0s before latest event (clamped).
Idx chosen=390, event_in_hold=False, hold_time_range=[390.0, 487.0], events_in_hold=0

TRAIN window fallback: tried [(97, 297)] → chosen W_train=97
HOLD window fallback: tried [(97, 5)] → chosen W_hold=97

Tail (TRAIN only): high
Θ* from TRAIN-only grid (HIGH [0.98, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85]),
FA cap ≤ 0.2/hr → Θ*=5.771441 @ q=0.98 (TRAIN FA/hr≈0.000)

Lead window: [0.0s, 90.0s]  |  Refractory: 60.0s
Permutations: 500

**Prediction:** CNT detects ≥65% of events within the lead window, median lead ≥15 s, ≤1 FA/hr.
